**EXTRA UPDATE**

This release contains various smaller bug fixes, a new local storage solution,
new and unread message notifications and a temporary ICO claim section for
claiming your genesis HEAT.

User support/feedback functionality has also been added to the client, use it
whenever you need help during the ICO claim process.

To claim your HEAT you could use both the web version and the desktop versions,
it is however more secure to use the desktop version since you can verifify
it's origin in ways that are simply not possible with any website.

The ICO claim process will ask you to provide the address(es) from which you've
sent your donations and will provide you with a confirmation address and a
small payment to your ICO address (to cover the transaction costs).

You are then to send a payment from your ICO address to the confirmation address
to confirm your ownership of that address. Confirmation is near instant and will
be visible in the claim section.

Your HEAT-TEST account (the one you use in this client) will be your final *real*
genesis account in the HEAT genesis block, so make sure you use a unique
secret phrase. You can claim multiple ICO addresses and assign them all to your
one single HEAT account.

The claim process helps you to properly backup your HEAT secret phrase (aka your
super secret/super important master key). Through the client UI you have the
option to:

  1. Print your secret phrase directly from the app to your printer
  2. Save/download your secret phrase to a file on your computer
  3. Copy the secret phrase to your clipboard
  4. View the secret phrase and make a picture/hand written note/etc..
